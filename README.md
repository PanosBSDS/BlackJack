## Structure

This game is a project example  and  is created with pure HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT (Jquery library).<br/>
This game is a different version of BlackJack game and provides a beautiful UI style created in css with image-cards and description of the cards.<br/>
The gameplay is manual, you have to create a name and a new ui style will appear with the cards and buttons.<br/>
Click the first button in order to pull a card and continue pull cards to make the highest total of the card numbers.<br/>
Click the second button in order to stop your round and then the next player can play.<br/>
The rules is my creation and idea to make the game a little more competitive and more funny.<br/>
